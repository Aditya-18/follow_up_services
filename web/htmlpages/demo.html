        <h2>What is &quot;follow up,&quot; anyway? </h2>
        <p>&quot;Follow up&quot; is a business strategy (really, it's a mindset) that fosters open communication</br>
            between a business and the customers they serve. This system encourages and enables customers to</br>
            voice their opinions honestly concerning the goods and services they receive from the business.</br>
            A successful follow up strategy can consistently monitor customer satisfaction and loyalty levels.</p>

        <h2>We already do our own follow up calls to our customers. Isn't that enough? </h2>
        <p>Most companies can &quot;follow up&quot; with their customers. However, most find it challenging</br>
           to do it consistently. Most companies also find that the information they receive may not be as </br>
           objective as they would like. In addition, the information obtained by in-house staff may get </br>
           &quot;watered-down&quot; by the time it reaches the top levels of management.</p>

        <h2>What should we consider before using your services? </h2>
        <p>First and foremost: Are you (or is your company) ready to hear and act upon the objective</br>
            customer information we will obtain for you? It is very important to avoid the situation</br> 
            of asking customers for their feedback and then giving the appearance of not doing anything </br>
            with that information. This will be counter-productive because your customers will think </br>
            that your commitment to customer service is merely lip-service.</p>

        <h2>What is the objective of CUSTOMER FOLLOW UP, Inc.? </h2>
        <p>We believe that customers are the best source of information that a business can draw on. </br>
            Our goal is to help a business grow by tapping into the power of objective customer feedback.</br>
            Obtaining this kind of information and implementing the changes the information suggests helps </br>
            ensure continued growth.</p>

        <h2>How often should we contact our customers? </h2>
        <p>There is no set formula for determining frequency of contact. However, too much contact can be </br>
            counter-productive. It is very appropriate to call a customer relatively soon after you provided </br>
            your service(s) to them. Their experiences with you are still fresh in their minds. Also, if there </br>
            are issues the sooner you know about them the better for all concerned. In addition, it may be </br>
            very useful to call customers several months after you provided services to them. This will help </br>
            you assess if your customer/technical support initiatives are working the way you think they should be.</br>
            These types of &quot;check-up&quot; calls can go a long way in making a customer feel that you are </br>
            really sincere in providing strong customer service.</p>
