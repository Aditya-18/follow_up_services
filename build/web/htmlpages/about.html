            CUSTOMER FOLLOW UP, Inc. was founded on the following fundamental beliefs:</br>
            The quality of customer service is one of the few variables that separate one business from 
            Call of the others that offer the same products and service. Customers are more qualified than
            anyone to assess the effectiveness of service. It costs 5 times more to get a new customer than 
            to keep an existing one. The quality of service is what compels a customer to stay with a business.
            Customers will pay higher fees to receive better service. No matter how sophisticated and advanced
            communication methods become, talking to customers yields some of the most insightful information there is.

    and that for a business to be successful they need to monitor the thoughts and opinions of their customers consistently and 
    objectively. This unbiased information assists a business tremendously in keeping on course to meet their growth and service
